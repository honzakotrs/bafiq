Based on your need to outperform samtools view -c by 2×, your current libdeflate use, and your efficient producer-consumer model, here’s a distilled, high-performance Rust tech stack with laser focus on throughput, parallel BGZF decompression, and record parsing:

🚀 High-Speed Rust Stack for BAM Processing

Layer	Library / Tool	Why it’s chosen
1. File I/O (Memory-efficient, fast)	memmap2 or std::fs::File + BufReader::with_capacity(1MB)	High throughput access, low syscalls, OS paging benefits.
2. BGZF Block Handling	Custom BGZF block scanner or noodles::bgzf	You need fine control over block splitting & parallelism.
3. Decompression	libdeflate (FFI wrapper)	Fastest GZIP-compatible decompressor available, 2× faster than zlib/miniz.
4. Threading (Decompress Workers)	rayon	Simple and powerful parallel iterator framework. Avoids hand-rolled thread pools.
5. Channeling & Pipelines	crossbeam-channel or flume	Efficient MPMC queues with or without backpressure.
6. BAM Parsing	noodles::bam	Clean, idiomatic Rust parsing of BAM records. Use LazyRecord to minimize allocation.
7. Optional SIMD / CRC Optimization	Inline C libdeflate with SIMD or zune-inflate	For hand-tuned performance where needed (e.g., CRC skipping, SIMD inflates).
8. Profiling / CPU Saturation Check	cargo flamegraph, perf, htop	Confirm your CPU is fully utilized across threads.

📊 Targeted Throughput Gains (Per Layer)

Layer	Optimization	Expected Gain
BGZF block parallelization	Split + parallel decompress	+1.5–2.0×
Use libdeflate FFI	Over flate2 or miniz_oxide	+1.2×
Avoid intermediate allocs	Reuse buffers	+10–20%
Profiled memory access	Reduce cache misses	+10%
CRC skipping (if safe)	Inline block handling	+5–10%

🧪 Bonus: Feature Flags to Enable
	•	noodles → compile with libdeflate feature for fastest decompression fallback
	•	Use nightly Rust only if you want:
	•	SIMD parsing via std::simd or
	•	Inline C libdeflate with bindgen for max SIMD path

⸻

❌ What to Avoid

Don’t use	Reason
flate2, miniz_oxide	~2× slower than libdeflate
Default noodles::bgzf::Reader alone	Single-threaded by default
Async over parallel for this use case	Parallel block decompression scales better than async here
Allocating new Vec<u8> per block	Use buffer pools or thread-local Vec::with_capacity

⸻

✅ Summary

This stack gives you:
	•	Parallel BGZF decompression using libdeflate in Rust
	•	Minimal overhead BAM parsing with noodles
	•	Full control of CPU/thread usage
	•	Foundation to surpass samtools speed, especially on multi-core systems
