# bafiq Development Plan

## Overview
Transform bafiq from experimental code into a production-ready bioinformatics tool with advanced index compression and genomic analysis capabilities.

## Core Insights to Incorporate
- **98.6% sparsity**: Only 56/4096 flag combinations used in real data
- **61.7% delta compression**: Block ID sequences compress very well  
- **100% monotonic ordering**: Block IDs correlate with genomic progression
- **Subsequence patterns**: Shared block sequences enable dictionary compression
- **Index-only analysis**: Most compression benefits achievable without reading BAM records
- **Streaming parallel processing**: Producer-consumer pattern for optimal memory/performance
  - One thread discovers BGZF blocks, multiple threads process immediately
  - Constant memory usage regardless of file size
  - Near-linear scaling with CPU cores

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete → Phase 2 Ready

**Phase 1 Completed:**
- Module architecture established (`index/`, `analysis/`, `query/`, `bgzf/`)
- IndexBuilder with streaming parallel processing (31.4s performance beating samtools 35.4s)
- Complete analysis suite (`analyze_compression_potential`, `analyze_index_only_compression`, `analyze_genomic_compression_potential`, `verify_genomic_coordinates`)
- Query engine foundation (`QueryEngine`, `QueryRequest`, iterators)
- CLI integration with new analysis modules
- tmp.rs cleanup and organization
- API cleanup and migration complete

**Ready for Phase 2:** Begin compression implementation using the analysis insights

**BGZF Refactoring Note:** COMPLETED - Successfully refactored to use centralized `bgzf.rs` module across all components

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Refactoring (Foundation) COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Index Building Module COMPLETED
- [x] Create `src/index/` module structure
- [x] Move BGZF parsing from tmp.rs to `index/builder.rs`
- [x] **Priority**: Implement streaming parallel processing as default
  - [x] Extract `build_flag_index_streaming_parallel` as primary builder
  - [x] Producer-consumer pattern for optimal memory usage (36.5s build time)
  - [x] Multi-threaded block processing with perfect scaling
- [x] Implement `IndexBuilder` struct with multiple backends:
  - [x] `ParallelStreaming` (default) - from streaming_parallel experiment
  - [x] `Sequential` (fallback) - from low_level approach  
  - [x] `HtsLib` (benchmark) - original rust-htslib approach
- [x] Add proper error handling and validation
- [x] Integration with main CLI (now uses streaming parallel by default)
- [ ] Write unit tests for BGZF parsing and parallel processing

#### 1.2 Analysis Module COMPLETED
- [x] Create `src/analysis/` module structure  
- [x] Move compression analysis functions from tmp.rs to `analysis/compression.rs`
  - [x] `analyze_compression_potential` - Advanced 4-level compression analysis
  - [x] `analyze_index_only_compression` - Block ID pattern analysis
  - [x] Helper functions: `analyze_block_subsequences`, `analyze_block_delta_compression`, `validate_block_ordering_assumption`
- [x] Move genomic analysis functions from tmp.rs to `analysis/genomic.rs`
  - [x] `analyze_genomic_compression_potential` - Genomic coordinate pattern analysis
  - [x] `verify_genomic_coordinates` - Coordinate validation
  - [x] Helper functions: `extract_genomic_ranges_from_block`, `analyze_genomic_overlap_patterns`, etc.
- [x] Update CLI commands to use new modules instead of tmp.rs
- [x] Public API exports in lib.rs for all analysis functions

**Note**: Started BGZF refactoring (`src/bgzf.rs` module created) but deferred to Phase 2 to avoid disrupting Phase 1 completion. The BGZF module provides centralized constants, `BgzfParser` utilities, and thread-local decompressors for future optimization.
